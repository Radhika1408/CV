    <h2>PROJECTS</h2>
    
    <h3>Testing Project:</h3>
    <h3> Duration- 1 Month</h3>
    
    <ul> <p> <h3>ActiTime:</h3> acttime is web based software for time tracking and management. It analyse team performance and reduce cost. ActiTIME is unique applications that enables the organisation, manages performance and generate precise reports regarding employees’ shifts and performance with the help of enhanced tool.
        Roles and Responsibilities</p>
    <li>I have written test scenario and test cases for FT, IT, ST and adhoc testing.</li>
    <li> The defect that I found was regarding functionality, Integration and system.</li></ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Acadamic Project :</h3>
    <ol><li><h3>Title: Smart Sensors for Water Quality Monitoring</h3></li>
        <p>Description: The system is able to measure physiochemical parameters of water quality, such as flow, temperature, pH, conductivity and the oxidation reduction potential. These physiochemical parameters are used to detect water contaminants.
            The sensors are connected to a microcontroller-based measuring node, which processes and analyses the data. The notification node presents the reading of the sensors and outputs an audio alert when water quality parameters reach unsafe levels. Various qualification tests are run to validate each aspect of the monitoring system. The sensors are shown to work within their intended accuracy ranges. The measurement node is able to transmit data via ZigBee to the notification node for audio and visual display. The results demonstrate that the system is capable of reading physiochemical parameters, and can successfully process, transmit and display the readings.</p>
           <h3><li>Moth Encircling a Lamppost in a Town Square</li></h3>
           <p>
            Graphics programming in opengl. The moth is flying around the lamppost. The camera rolls and comes to
            the position ideal to view the flying moth.
